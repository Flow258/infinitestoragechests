Infinite Storage Chests Plugin

Description:
This plugin adds craftable chests with infinite storage capabilities to Minecraft. Players can store unlimited amounts of the same item in a single chest slot, making inventory management much easier.

Features:
- Custom craftable chests with infinite stacking
- Unique GUI for easy item management
- Configurable limits for balance
- Withdraw items in normal stack sizes
- Sorting and search functionality
- Customizable crafting recipe
- Admin commands and permissions

Crafting Recipe:
Players can craft an Infinite Storage Chest using:
- 4 Obsidian
- 4 Ender Pearls
- 1 Chest

Technical Details:
The plugin stores item counts separately from Minecraft’s inventory system, allowing unlimited stacking without breaking game mechanics. A database or file-based system is used to manage storage data.

Commands:
- /giveinfinitechest <player> - Gives a player the custom chest
- /infinitechest reload - Reloads the plugin configuration

Permissions:
- infinitechest.craft - Allows crafting of the chest
- infinitechest.use - Allows usage of the chest
- infinitechest.admin - Grants admin privileges

Configuration:
The config.yml file allows server admins to customize:
- Max unique items per chest
- Infinite stacking toggle
- Custom crafting recipe

Gameplay Considerations:
To maintain balance, the crafting recipe is expensive. Server admins can also limit the number of chests a player can own. The plugin is designed to work with economy and land-claim plugins.

Future Features:
- Upgradable chests with different storage capacities
- Linked chests sharing a single inventory
- Remote chest access from anywhere in the world

Installation:
1. Download the plugin JAR file.
2. Place it in the server’s plugins folder.
3. Restart the server.
4. Configure settings in config.yml if needed.

Enjoy managing your items more efficiently with Infinite Storage Chests!
